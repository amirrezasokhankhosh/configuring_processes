# configuring_processes

for see the results of the project run the show.py file and for giving input to it 
edit the "Input_main" file

* CONSIDER that you don't need to edit input.txt and output.txt file at all you'll see the results in chart of python.

* the main file doesn't compile the app file so if you want to change the app file you'll need to compile it your self to see the new results by main file.
